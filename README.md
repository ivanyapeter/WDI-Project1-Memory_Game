## Overview

# <a id="goals"></a>
#### Goals
* Build a web application from scratch, without a starter codebase
* Use problem solving to determine game logic for a simple game
* Separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in your application
* Build an application to a spec that are given
* Build a dynamic game that allows two players to compete
* Have a README.md file that explains the app

# <a id="technical-requirements"></a>
#### Technical Requirements
Your app must:
* Render a game board in the browser
* Switch turns between X and O (or whichever markers you select) 
* Visually display which side won if a player gets three in a row or show a draw/cat’s game if neither does
* Have separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
* Use jQuery and/or pure javascript DOM API for DOM manipulation
* Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principles
* Be deployed on a host somewhere where the rest of the world can see it
* Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)
