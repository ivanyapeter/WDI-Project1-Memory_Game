# <a id="overview"></a>
#### Overview
This is a classic memory game with time constrain and number of tries per game. I created this memory game to be played in all size of browser.

# <a id="goals"></a>
#### Goals
* Build a web application from scratch, without a starter codebase
* Use problem solving to determine game logic for a simple game
* Separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in your application
* Build an application to a spec that are given
* Build a dynamic game that allows two players to compete
* Have a README.md file that explains the app

# <a id="technical-requirements"></a>
#### Technical Requirements
The app must:
* Render a game board in the browser
* Switch turns between X and O (or whichever markers you select) 
* Visually display which side won if a player gets three in a row or show a draw/cat’s game if neither does
* Have separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
* Use jQuery and/or pure javascript DOM API for DOM manipulation
* Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principles
* Be deployed on a host somewhere where the rest of the world can see it
* Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

# <a id="constraint"></a>
#### Constraint
Time: require to deliver a working and tested product within 4 days

# <a id="deliverables"></a>
